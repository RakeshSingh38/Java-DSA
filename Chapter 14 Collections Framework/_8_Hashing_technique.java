        // Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.
        // Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:
        // In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.

        // to implement hashing we use hash tables
        // and each location in the hash table is called a bucket
        // each bucket contains a key value pair
        // hash table will some size ( adjustable )  

        // we must have 25% blanks spaces in the hash table
        // and only 75% of the hash table must be used (known as loading factor)

        // and 50% of the hash table must be used for keys
