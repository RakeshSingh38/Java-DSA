// imp      if u see similar Q theres a high chance that the Q is same

// r        In Binary search use Iterative apporach instead of recursive apporach, as it has good time complexity 
//                 

// r         Always look the constraints before solving the Question on Leetcode , it hints the answers

// r        Dry run the code to understand the flow of the code
//          Pen and paper apporach is the best way to solve the Q

//          use git show to see the previous commit and see the changes made in the code
//  and try to put the same as answer it as previously solved
Eg 852 == 162          

// tip      if u want if and else answer then make a function and get true or false and according to it
//          return the answer
        if(isPrime(n)){
                System.out.println("Prime");
        }
        else{
                System.out.println("Not Prime");
        }
        // can be written as
        System.out.println(isPrime(n)?"Prime":"Not Prime");

        // tip     i find out that no matter where the class is written it can be executed till the name matches the file name
        // as i have 2 files named Shop.java and both are conflicting with each other
        so i have to change the name of the file to execute the code
        // i changed the name of the file to ShopforClass.java in Class folder of Chapter 8 Object Oriented Programming
        // and it worked fine
