// imp      if u see similar Q theres a high chance that the Q is same

// r        In Binary search use Iterative apporach instead of recursive apporach, as it has good time complexity 
//                 

// r         Always look the constraints before solving the Question on Leetcode , it hints the answers

// r        Dry run the code to understand the flow of the code
//          Pen and paper apporach is the best way to solve the Q

//          use git show to see the previous commit and see the changes made in the code
//  and try to put the same as answer it as previously solved
Eg 852 == 162
