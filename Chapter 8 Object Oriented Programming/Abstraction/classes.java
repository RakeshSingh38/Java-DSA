// Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
//Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces 

/* 
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

    // implements an abstract method

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz");
    }

class Cat extends Animal {
    // follows the rules of an abstract class
    public void animalSound() {
        System.out.println("The cat says: meow meow");
    }

        //           â†“      
        //          var myObj = new Animal();

        // Q     Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?
        // r     To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.
