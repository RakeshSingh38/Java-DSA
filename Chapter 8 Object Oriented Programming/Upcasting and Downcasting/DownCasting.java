Downcasting is a process that involves transforming a superclass reference into a subclass reference. 
Contrary to upcasting, downcasting, often called "narrowing", is not performed automatically and is potentially unsafe. 
It can lead to a ClassCastException if the object being downcasted is not actually an instance of the subclass.

// Downcasting is the opposite of upcasting, which is casting a superclass to a subclass.
// Explicit conversion is done by the programmer.

    }

// no parameters
